### Next

Now you have completed all lessons, well done! 

However, it's not over. R is an evolving language, and new things added every day. Now it's on you to keep up to date.
A good way to keep up to date is to regularly check the following websites:

- [R Views blog](https://rviews.rstudio.com/) 
- [R Bloggers webpage](https://www.r-bloggers.com/)
- [R posts you might have missed!](https://twitter.com/icymi_r)

Also remember to update R from time to time, and also to check for RStudio updates.

Good luck and best wishes in your career,

Umberto and Josiah
