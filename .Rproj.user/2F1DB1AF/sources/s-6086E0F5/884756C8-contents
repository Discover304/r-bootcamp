# Welcome!


If you're here it's because you want to learn how to go from this

<br>

```{r echo=FALSE, layout = 'l-body-outset'}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(rmarkdown)

paged_table(penguins)
```

<br>

to this

<br>

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins, aes(flipper_length_mm, bill_length_mm, 
                     color = species, pch = species)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Flipper length (in mm)", y = "Bill length (in mm)",
       color = "Penguin species",
       pch = "Penguin species")
```

Collecting a large amount of data and looking at it in excel is not helpful for humans, it does not give us any insights or knowledge.

Knowledge is obtained by creating suitable summaries and visual displays from the data.

To succeed in this bootcamp you will only need:

1. a laptop
2. active learning (just reading the material won't be enough, you need to type along the code and get familiar with errors)
3. willingness to learn

Ready, set, go!
